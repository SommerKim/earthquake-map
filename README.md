# leaflet-challenge

For this challenge, I created a map with circle markers depicting locations of earthquakes from the past week's data as reported by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The circles on the map reflect the reported earthquake's magnitude by size: The higher magnitude the earthquake, the larger radius of the circle marking the earthquake. As the legend shows, the color of the circle reflects the earthquake's depth.
